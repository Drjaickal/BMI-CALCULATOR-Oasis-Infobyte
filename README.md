## Simple Python BMI Calculator with GUI

This repository contains a basic Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built using Python and the `tkinter` library for a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI).

### Features

* Calculates BMI based on weight (kg) and height (cm).
* Displays the calculated BMI value.
* Provides a simple interface for user interaction.

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3 (Download from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

**Instructions:**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   [gh repo clone Drjaickal/BMI-CALCULATOR-Oasis-Infobyte](https://github.com/Drjaickal/BMI-CALCULATOR-Oasis-Infobyte.git)
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd python-bmi-calculator
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python bmi_calculator.py
   ```

### Using the Calculator

The script launches a window with labels for weight and height, entry fields for input, and a button to calculate the BMI.

1. Enter your weight (in kilograms) in the weight entry field.
2. Enter your height (in centimeters) in the height entry field.
3. Click the "Calculate BMI" button.

The application displays the calculated BMI value below the button.

### Code Structure

The project includes a single Python file (`bmi_calculator.py`) that contains:

* Functions for user input handling, BMI calculation, and result display.
* Code to create the GUI elements using `tkinter`.

### Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this project! You can:

* Improve the user interface by adding visuals or different layouts.
* Implement error handling for invalid user input.
* Translate the application to other languages.
